This little script converts from ImpulseTracker (IT) modules to Sierra AGI SOUND resources.

It supports 3 channels of voices and the 4th noise channel, as well as volume changes and note-off commands.

You'll need PERL installed to run it.

TODO:
1. copy instructions from the file.
1. write a better README.
